## Submission Instructions

### Overview
My project consists of helping people keep track of maintenance tasks that might slip our minds from time to time. For example changing a furnace filter or changing out a water filter. Today life is very busy and trying to remember everything is difficult. This  web app will be able to assist with our busy schedules. 

Users will be able to assign their task a name and leave a note describing the task at hand. The user can also add a picture to help remind them of what and where the task will need to be performed. The user can set a reminder as to how often that task will need to be performed. If a task doesn't need to be performed anymore then the user will be able to delete such task.
